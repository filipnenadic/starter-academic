This research was completed in collaboration with [Jelena Stanišić](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yWZ6OFEAAAAJ&hl=sr&oi=ao) and [Slavica Maksić](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bt3DWK4AAAAJ&hl=sr&oi=ao).

Human activity is polluting the planet and changing the climate. Developing environmental awareness, defined as XYZ, in schools is important.

We used the data collected in the [TIMSS 2019 project](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2019/) to investigate what predicts higher environmental awareness among fourth grade primary school students in Serbia (roughly 10 years old). TIMSS includes a number of questions that 

The results showed that variables varying on the individual student level are predictive of their environmental awareness. These include 

I﻿nterestingly, there were no differences between schools when individual student characteristics are taken into account. There were still some differences between groups of students taught by different teachers, but the teacher characteristics that we investigated were not predictive of these differences.

In sum, it seems that at the present moment schools have little impact on the development of environmental awareness in their students; student achievement is instead predicted by their home environment, confidence, and understanding why the material they learn is important. We discuss these findings, including what schools might do to increase their impact on the ecological awareness level of their students, in this paper freely available in [](https://doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0579-64312301051S)
