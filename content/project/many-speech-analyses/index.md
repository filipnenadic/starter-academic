This research was completed in collaboration with [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://nascl.rc.nau.edu/benjamin-v-tucker/), [Scott James Perry](https://scottjamesperry.com/), and [Matthew C. Kelley](https://mason.gmu.edu/~mkelle21/). But not just with them -- the purpose of the project was to involve a large number of different researchers individually or in small teams (like our four-member team) in an effort to answer the same research question using a shared dataset so the number of contributors to the project is very large. Here, I will only mention the three leading researchers, originators of the idea for this project: [Stefano Corretta](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/), [Joseph V. Casillas](https://www.jvcasillas.com/about.html), and [Timo B. Roettger](https://www.simplpoints.com/).

Our team, like everyone else, received the same dataset from an experiment...

Of course, much more information can be found in [the published paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25152459231162567) and on the [OSF project page](https://osf.io/3bmcp/).
