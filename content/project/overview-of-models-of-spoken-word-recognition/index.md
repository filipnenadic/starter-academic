[This brief overiew of computational models of spoken word recognition](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-95504-1.00825-5) was written with [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAcBEoQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matthew C. Kelley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nuEwhrIAAAAJ&hl=en). In it, we describe the process of spoken word recognition and discuss the goals of computational models of this process. We also examine similarities and differences among existing models and argue for the importance of simulating a wide range of empirical phenomena while providing accessible computational implementations. The paper includes a chronological overview of notable publications, presented as a figure. Each entry in the timeline is a hyperlink to the online version of the corresponding publication. The timeline is also available on [this OSF page](https://osf.io/k3zq7/overview).
