This research was completed in collaboration with [Pamela Coulter](https://www.sac-oac.ca/pamela-coulter-msc-s-lpc), [Terrance M. Nearey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHYtdrMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Michael Kiefte](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/health/scsd/faculty-staff/our-faculty/Michael-Kiefte.html).

We synthesized vowels and suppressed either their first or the second formant, just like Ito and his associates did. You can see the effect of this suppression in images (b) and (c) above and you can also have a listen to an example vowel below. The first formant value in this example synthesized vowel was 500 Hz and the value of the second formant was 2000 Hz.

Original synthesized vowel:

{{< audio src="/audio/F1_500_F2_2000_org.wav" >}}

First formant suppressed:

{{< audio src="/audio/F1_500_F2_2000_nF1.wav" >}}

Second formant suppressed:

{{< audio src="/audio/F1_500_F2_2000_nF2.wav" >}}

The inspection of participant responses showed that – even when a formant is suppressed – changes in formant values affect participant categorizations. In other words, it looked like suppressing a formant does not alter participants' perception as much as one would expect, matching the findings reported by Ito and associates.  However, some closer quantitative analysis indicated that participant still don't agree as much in their vowel identification when a formant (especially if it is the first formant) is suppressed.

One issue with the synthesized vowels Ito and associates and we used is that they do not change their formant values as they unfold. However, English features many diphthongs, that is, vowels that change their quality as they unfold. For example, the vowel in the word "snow" or the vowel in the word "out". We thought that we needed more realistic stimuli to better assess the impact formant suppression has on vowel identification. We created new synthetic vowels and these featured formants with changing values over time. In fact, they were created to match the general production of vowels in Canadian English, taken from previous [research conducted by Nearey and Assmann](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.394433?casa_token=y2HsctvbDT4AAAAA:VWtrSGs0dHLyefZ8T1A3uR7wvmUs8R0A-SpF63Po-GofDJggc6BjzR5F5kDsCUnT_eTMG8qdB2yb). Listen to the sounds below, they are examples of vowel /[eɪ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/e/)/, like in the word "paint".

Original synthesized vowel:

{{< audio src="/audio/ey_orig.wav" >}}

First formant suppressed:

{{< audio src="/audio/ey_nof1.wav" >}}

Second formant suppressed:

{{< audio src="/audio/ey_nof2.wav" >}}

The results showed that suppressing the first formant dramatically changes vowel perception in vowels that have a large change in the value of the first formant throughout its produciton. In English, these vowels are /[ɪ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/i/), [ɛ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/%c9%9b/), [oʊ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/o/), [eɪ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/e/)/. In other words, not having access to formant information would really impede vowel perception in everyday conversation, where vowels do have more substantial formant change as they unfold.
