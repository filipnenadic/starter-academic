This research was completed in collaboration with [Pamela Coulter](https://www.sac-oac.ca/pamela-coulter-msc-s-lpc), [Terrance M. Nearey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHYtdrMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Michael Kiefte](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/health/scsd/faculty-staff/our-faculty/Michael-Kiefte.html).

So, we created new synthetic vowels and these did feature formants with changing values over time. In fact, they were created to match the general production of vowels in Canadian English, taken from previous [research conducted by Nearey and Assmann](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.394433?casa_token=y2HsctvbDT4AAAAA:VWtrSGs0dHLyefZ8T1A3uR7wvmUs8R0A-SpF63Po-GofDJggc6BjzR5F5kDsCUnT_eTMG8qdB2yb). Listen to the sounds below: they are examples of vowel /[eɪ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/e/)/, like in the word "paint", in its original form and when first and second formant are suppressed.

The results showed that suppressing the first formant dramatically changes vowel perception in vowels that have a large change in the value of the first formant throughout its produciton. In English, these vowels are /[ɪ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/i/), [ɛ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/%c9%9b/), [oʊ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/o/), [eɪ](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/e/)/. In other words, not having access to formant information would really impede vowel perception in everyday conversation, where vowels do have more substantial formant change as they unfold. You can read more about this in our [research article](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/10.0002110).
