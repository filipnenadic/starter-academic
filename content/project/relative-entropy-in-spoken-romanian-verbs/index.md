This research was completed in collaboration with [Petar Milin](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/languages/milin-petar.aspx) and [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/index.html).

In certain languages, new forms of a word with slightly different meanings can be created by adding one of the standard set of so-called inflectional suffixes used in that language. For example, the verb *work* can be made to fit a third person by adding an inflectional suffix *\-s* to make *he/she/it works*. Languages like Serbian or Romanian belong to the group of inflected languages because they use this tool to create different forms of words profusely. In the image below, taken from [Milin et al. (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X08000831?casa_token=vPKibcyA1RwAAAAA:ajdcPyq1oeosF6HT2gW3zMJ4Vy8qLHiZs6D51p3ZlGx_00yHgpgplVmYHTmoV_S9RdoU5eKC-ss), you can see that in Serbian as many as seven different suffixes presented on the x-axis can be attached to the base of the feminine noun *book* (*knjig*) to create new word forms. For example, *knjigom* means *with the book*. Some of these suffixes may have more than one meaning or serve more than one function, but that is a whole different story altogether.

Many words in an inflected language follow the same process of inflection, that is, they use the same inflectional suffixes. These words are then said to belong to the same inflectional class, as is the case with the example feminine nouns *book*, *strength*, and *open-sea* in Serbian. In the example below, *book* has a distribution of relative frequencies of its word-forms that is nearly identical to the one of the entire class it belongs to (feminine a-class). In turn, the Serbian word meaning *open-sea* shows a substantial lack of alignment to the class. This lack of alignment is called "relative entropy". Previous studies showed that words with a word-form frequency distribution more similar to the word-form frequency of the entire class they belong to are also processed faster. In other words, it is easier to deal with words like *book* which show a word-form frequency pattern like most words in their class, than with words like *open-sea*.

These findings come primarily from visual lexical decision studies.



Spoken word recognition and reading are not quite one and the same. 

We decided to test these findings in a new language (Romanian) and using spoken word recognition, so we administered an auditory lexical decision task, rather than a visual one.

Our results show that ...
