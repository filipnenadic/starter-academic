T﻿his project was done in collaboration with Ryan G. Podlubny, Daniel Schmidtke, Matthew C. Kelley, and Benjamin V. Tucker.

T﻿here is a debate about what is necessary and what is used when recognizing (spoken) words.

R﻿ecently, there has been some evidence that in visual word recognition, variables related to word meaning also influence perception. The These findings are important because they tell us that we are differently sensitive to word

T﻿hen researchers started to wonder about spoken word recognition Goh et al. W﻿e decided to test these findings using a much larger set of words, which was made available through the MALD project.

O﻿ur results indicate that both rating-based and corpus-based measures predict participant response latency in the auditory lexical decision task, even when we statistically control for other relevant word characteristics. The figure on the top of this page is one example f: we see that low valence (negative words) and high valence (positive) words are recognized earlier in comparison to words with neutral valence.
