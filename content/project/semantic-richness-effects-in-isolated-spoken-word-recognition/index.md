This project was done in collaboration with [Ryan G. Podlubny](https://podlubny.wordpress.com/home/), [Daniel Schmidtke](https://www.danschmidtke.com/), [Matthew C. Kelley](https://faculty.washington.edu/mattck/), and [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/index.html).

There is a debate about what is necessary and what is used when recognizing (spoken) words. McQueen.

At first slowly, but now more steadily, evidence accumulated that various word characteristics related to word meaning also influence visual word recognition. For example, we are quicker to recognize concrete words than abstract words (example), more dangeours words (example), or more arousing words (example). However, reading is not the same as listening to speech -- I won't go into details here, but I'm sure you can think of some differences -- so what happens in spoken word recognition? Goh et al. (ref) conducted a fairly large study to test just that and found that various semantic richness variables predicted participant performance in both the auditory lexical decision task and semantic classification task.

Still, the items used by Goh et al. (ref) were limited in some regards. For example, the approximatelly 400 words they presented to their participants were all high-concreteness nouns. We decided to test whether their findings can be replicated using a much larger and more diverse set of words, as well as a larger number of participants, both made available through the MALD project. We increased the number of considered words from X to X and the figure below shows the distribution of word concreteness ranging from 1 to 5 in Goh et al. and MALD stimuli.

Our results indicate that both rating-based and corpus-based measures predict participant response latency in the auditory lexical decision task, even when we statistically control for other relevant word characteristics. The figure on the top of this page is one example for what we find: we see that low valence (negative words) and high valence (positive) words are recognized earlier in comparison to words with neutral valence.

It seems that some of the models of (isolated) spoken word recognition may need some updating to account for effects such as these, although additional studies to better scrutinize these efefcts and how they differ between different word types may be needed (). For more information about this study, see our paper.
