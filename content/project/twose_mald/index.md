This project was completed in collaboration with [Pearl Lorentzen](https://www.pearllorentzen.com/), [Matthew C. Kelley](https://mason.gmu.edu/~mkelle21/), and [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAcBEoQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Most experiments are conducted in laboratory conditions. This is because researchers want to make sure that the results they obtain are not a consequence of some external factor that was not predicted and perhaps even exerted its influence unnoticed. One downside of collecting psycholinguistic data exclusively in the laboratory is that it requires the human language user to come to the lab, which is time-consuming for the participant. Many participants are therefore selected by convenience and share characteristics that may distinguish them from other humans that do not participate in studies nearly as often (see, as an example, the construct of [WEIRD -- Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic -- participants](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-inthe-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17)).

We published a [brief report](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/3570faad-56d1-4b2a-9c5f-06eb090f60e4) on the results. The study is also briefly summarized and the data is made available in a subsequent [encyclopedia publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780323955041001848?via%3Dihub). The encyclopedia chapter also includes other information about MALD and included [Yoichi Mukai](https://yoichimukai.rbind.io/) and [Scott James Perry](https://scottjamesperry.com/) as coauthors as well.
